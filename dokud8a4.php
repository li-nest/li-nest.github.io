I am always looking for highly self-motivated <b>Ph.D.</b> students who are strongly committed to research. The successful candidates are expected to conduct research in network science, cyber security, and big data.<br /><br />

If you are interested, please send your resume or CV, transcripts, TOEFL and GRE scores, and everything else that you believe will help your application to me in one email. Prior research experience is a plus but is not absolutely necessary. I am more interested in working with students who are responsible, brilliant, with solid background, and have curiosity and determination to explore the path to develop himself/herself into an outstanding researcher. <br /><br />
